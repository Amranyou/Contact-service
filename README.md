# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that the software I develop is functional and secure by following the software industry's best practices for developing software. Part of following industry standards is employing known software testing techniques, such as dynamic and static testing. In addition to software testing, the software industry also has standards and best practices for producing quality and secure applications that serve a purpose and meet their organization's requirements.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Software development relies on requirements to outline the scope and purpose of the system being developed. Developing an application without first identifying the requirements is analogous to building a road that leads to nowhere. Identifying software requirements is an iterative approach that starts with broad interpretations of what the software should do and gradually refines the requirements to answer specific questions about the implementation, design, and technologies used in the software.


# How do I approach designing software?
My first approach to designing software is understanding the business requirements to determine the feasibility of the client's request. The next step is an analysis of the requirements to identify the knowns and unknowns of the system being designed. The analysis stage aims to identify the client's requirements to suggest an informed software designed before coding starts.
